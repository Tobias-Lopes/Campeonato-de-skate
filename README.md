# Skateboarding Championship

You are helping the physical education department in the first UFRN skateboarding championship. In this championship, what matters most is regularity. To achieve this, the championship takes place over 3 consecutive days and each day the skater will have 3 different scores. The score of the day is defined as the score that is neither the highest nor the lowest for that day. If there is a repeated score, the score will be given by the score that was repeated (either 2 or 3 times). The skater's final score is given in the same way, but considering the 3 scores resulting from each day.

For example, suppose the skater scored 3, 7, and 2 on the first day, 3, 4, and 4 on the second, and 2, 2, 8 on the third. In this case, the score for the first day will be 3, the second day will be 4 and the third day will be 2. Considering the scores 3, 4 and 2 obtained, the final score will be 3.
